Name of Student:  Juan Hasbun

Name of Project:  Genshin Impact Fansite

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?):

 This will be a fansite that contains data (stats) of all the characters availiable for the videogame Genshin Impact, it will also have additional features as time allows and expandable to add more features/stretchgoals as time allows during Capstone weeks / future.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

  The absolute minmium requirement, is a database (with methods to add to it) of the roster of characters that includes information about the character, stats, background, skills, this project is not intended to be completed by the end of 2 weeks but as a the basic foundation to expand into a larger site as more and more features are added.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

  The plan is to use React with Firebase to create a large database that will allow me to create default pages that are pre-formated and simply display the currently selected character on the fly with a state change.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

  The goal of this website is long-term and setup to allow future features to be included as time goes on. Such possible features include - a database for Equipment, Artifacts, Consumable Items, Bestiary, a link to Genshin Impacts own googlemap API, possibly include videos or animations of each character(and their skills) or of enemies from the bestiary, long-term goal of include an Artifact Plannar that will allow a visitor to create and plan what Artifacts are ideal for their character to use.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

  Not at this time. As pointed out in a previous email, this Capstone is mostly about the database and for building the basic foundations to expand for the future.
  **Updated: 10/10/21 - due to unforseen bugs, I had to scrap the project using React and rebuild a simpiler model using C#/java to present a proof of concept version that I can later go back and redo in React once I'm more comfortable using the langauge**
